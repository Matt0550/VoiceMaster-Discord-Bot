# StageMaster

**StageMaster is a discord bot** created to change the way servers work, instead of having permanent channels you can now create temporary ones that delete themselves once they are empty.

The original code was taken from the [VoiceMaster bot](https://github.com/SamSanai/VoiceMaster-Discord-Bot) and adapted to my needs.

_The bot is programmed via [**discord.py**](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) and it's tested with Python 3.9_
# Requirements
- [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
- [validators](https://pypi.org/project/validators/)
# Setup the bot:

1. Download python using the following link:

- [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone the bot from GitHub

3. Open the terminal and follow these steps:

- Change directory to this folder and type:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Open `bot.py` in a text editor and replace `"Insert Discord token here"` with your token bot

5. Open `cogs/stage.py` in a text editor and replace `"Owner id"` with your owner id (line 114 and 151)

6. Run the bot

**Remember to enable the "PRESENCE INTENT" and "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" on [Discord Devolper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)**
